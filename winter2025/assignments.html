              Homework assignments will mainly involve building out prototypes for
              applications that we will discuss in class. For example, you will
              learn to create your own instagram-like filters or snapchat-like
              masks or smart-car lane detectors.

              <i>hw*.ipynb</i>
              ipython notebook file that will guide you through the homework.
              This file will ask you to code up functions in other
              <i>*.py</i>
              files and may even ask you to fill in short answers or equations
              in the ipython notebook. All the instructions necessary for the
              homework are contained in these

      <h2>How to submit your assignments?</h2>
      <p>
        After you have completed each assignment, you need to submit the
        following deliverables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>hw*.pdf</i>
          - Export the hw*.ipynb ipython notebook as a PDF and submit it to the
          Gradescope site under the assignment called
          <b>Homework * PDF</b>
          . In order to export notebook as a PDF, you will need to
          <a
            href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-nbconvert"
          >
            install additional libraries
          </a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hw*.ipynb, *.py</i>
          - All the python files we ask you to code up must be submitted to
          Gradescope as well under the assignment called
          <b>Homework * Code</b>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          If you experience errors with the Gradescope site and are about to
          miss the deadline for submitting the assignment, then attach your
          completed assignment to a private Ed post with the subject
          <b>[CS131-HW* submission]</b> so that we have a record of your work.

      <h2>How to start working on an assignment?</h2>
      <p>Before working on each homework, you need to setup a few things:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Installing Python 3.6+:</b>
        To use python3, make sure to install
        <b>version 3.6+</b>
        on your local machine. If you are on Mac OS X, you can do this using
        <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>
        with
        <code>
          brew install
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/f2a764ef944b1080be64bd88dca9a1d80130c558/Formula/python.rb
        </code>
        . You can find instructions for Ubuntu
        <a
          href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04"
        >
          here
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <b>Setting up a virtual environment:</b>
        we strongly recommend working using a single
        <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">
          virtual environment
        </a>
        for all homeworks. This will allow you to have a working environment
        with all the package dependencies within the repository of your
        homework, without messing up your work environment in other
        repositories.
      </p>
      <p>
        All necessary dependencies for your CS131 homeworks can be found in a
        single
        <a
          href="https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_release/blob/master/requirements.txt"
        >
          requirements.txt
        </a>
        file, which has been placed at the root of the homework release
        repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set up a virtual environment with name
        <code>.env</code>
        , run the following inside your homework directory (ex: inside
        <code>cs131/</code>
        ):
      </p>
      <pre>
sudo pip install virtualenv        # You will need to do this only once
virtualenv -p python3 .env         # Creates a virtual environment with python3
source .env/bin/activate           # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install all the dependencies
# Work on the assignement for a while...
deactivate                         # Exit the virtual environment when you're done</pre
      >

      <p>
        Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should run
        <code>source .env/bin/activate</code>
        (from within your assignment folder) to re-activate the virtual
        environment, and
        <code>deactivate</code>
        again whenever you are done.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          Working with
          <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>
          :
        </b>
        in your assignment repository, start the notebook with the
        <code>jupyter notebook</code>
        command. You might have issues if you are in a virtual environment, as
        the notebook might not recognize your virtual environment and might not
        find the kernel located in
        <code>.env</code>
        to execute code. In this case, refer to
        <a
          href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/IPythonNotebookVirtualenvs/"
        >
          this page
        </a>
        and do the following within your virtual environment:
      </p>
      <pre>python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my-virtualenv-name</pre>
      <p>
        If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, you can also refer this
        <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial">IPython tutorial</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with a Jupyter notebook, you can edit the
        <code>*.py</code>
        files either in the Jupyter interface (in your browser) or with your
        favorite editor (vim, Atom...). Whenever you save a
        <code>*.py</code>
        file, the notebook will reload their content directly.

        <h2>How do you download the assignments?</h2>
        <p>
          All the assignments will be released via github. You can download the
          files directly from the website. But instead, we recommend, you use
          <b>git</b>
          to download the assignments because this will make it easy for you to
          update the assignments in case there is an update. The instructions
          below describe how to use git to download our assignments.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Installing Git</h4>
        <p>Follow the instructions here:</p>
        <pre>https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</pre>

        <h4>
          2. Downloading the assignments and lecture notes to your local
          machine.
        </h4>
        <p>
          In terminal, run the following to copy the released homework directory
          to your desktop.
        </p>
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_release.git</pre>
        <p>Run the following to copy the lecture notes directory.</p>
        <pre>git clone https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_notes</pre>

        <h4>
          3. In case there are updates to the assignments, update your local
          code using this.
        </h4>
        To update your local repository to the newest commit, execute
        <pre>git pull</pre>
        <p>
          This will fetch the changes that TAs made in the remote directory, so
          your local directory will be up-to-date with the remote one. Be
          careful that sometimes if the TAs and you are changing the same lines,
          there will be a conflict, and you may have to fix the conflicts
          mannually.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you did something wrong and want to give up local changes,
          which hopefully never happens ;), execute
        </p>
        <pre>git checkout -- &lt;filename&gt;</pre>
        <!--
        <h4>4. (For class notes only) Commit Your Changes</h4>
        <p>
          Ignore this step for submitting assignments. This section describes
          how you should submit class notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before submitting your lecture notes, you will only need to commit
          your lecture notes to the lecture notes directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.1 Create your own branch by running the following, where for
          example, branchname could be "lecture1", and then switch to the new
          branch.
        </p>
        <pre>
git branch lecture1
git checkout lecture1</pre
        >
        <p>
          4.2 Add your local changed files, commit the changes and push to your
          branch by running the followings.
        </p>
        <pre>
git add &lt;filename&gt;
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push</pre
        >
        <p>4.3 Then you need to merge your branch back to master.</p>
        <pre>git merge master</pre>
        Now go online to your branch on the
        <a href="https://github.com/StanfordVL/CS131_notes">
          class notes repository
        </a>
        and click on
        <b>submit a pull request</b>
        . We will be able to track your class notes, give you feedback and grade
        your work using this pull request.

      <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Study groups are allowed but we expect students to understand and

          student.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you worked in a group, please put the names of your study group on

        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, we expect students to not look at implementations online.
